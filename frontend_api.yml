    # Introduction
    This is a user interface for online travel agencies (OTAs) to add contract details they have with
    Airline, global distribution systems (GDS), etc into SmartMarkup. The purpose of SmartMarkup is to
    identify the right markup so agencies can maximize their profits by managing sales and margins.<br/>

    Trip Ninja uses a REST API with requests and responses in JSON format. For development and testing,
    the pre-production url is to be used. Once ready for live use, access to the production url will be provided. <br/>

    Pre-Production URL: to provide later

    For security, Trip Ninjaâ€™s servers are only accessible from whitelisted IPs. Please contact your account manager to whitelist IPs you
    will be using.

    # Authentication
    Trip Ninja uses Basic Authentication standards. Simply encode your username and password string using base64 and pass it in the
    authorization headers. See the python example below on how this is done. In the example, the payload and API endpoint url are not
    shown.

    Python Example:

    <pre>
    import base64
    auth = base64.b64encode("USERNAME:PASSWORD")
    headers = {
        'authorization': "Basic "+ auth,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    </pre>

    # Error Codes
    <table>
      <tr><td>400-1001</td><td>Invalid Input</td></tr>
      <tr><td>400-3003</td><td>Contract reference ID not found</td></tr>
      <tr><td>400-3004</td><td>Already Exist</td></tr>
